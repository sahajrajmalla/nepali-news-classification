# nepali-news-classification


Developing the DistilBERT model with Sequence Classification on 9 newsgroup datasets for the Nepali language with 95.475% accuracy. It was trained using Transfer Learning on a pretrained model from HuggingFace called [suyogyaart/nepali-newsgroup-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/suyogyaart/nepali-newsgroup-classification).


With the help of this codebase, I managed to win IT MEET 2022's AI Compitetion Text Challenge organized by Kathmandu University and F1Soft.
